(defn slack
  "Posts events into a slack.com channel using Incoming Webhooks.
  Takes your account name, webhook token, bot username and channel name.
  Returns a function that will post a message into slack.com channel:

  (def credentials {:account \"some_org\", :token \"53CR3T\"})
  (def slacker (slack credentials {:username \"Riemann bot\"
                                   :channel \"#monitoring\"
                                   :icon \":smile:\"}))

  (by [:service] slacker)

  Hint: token is the last part of the webhook URL that Slack gives you.
  https://hooks.slack.com/services/QWERSAFG0/AFOIUYTQ48/120984SAFJSFR
  Token in this case would be 120984SAFJSFR

  You can also supply a custom formatter for formatting events into Slack
  messages. Formatter result may contain:

    * `username` - overrides the username provided upon construction
    * `channel` - overrides the channel provided upon construction
    * `icon` - overrides the icon provided upon construction
    * `text` - main text formatted using Slack markup
    * `attachments` - array of attachments according to https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments

  (def slacker (slack credentials {:username \"Riemann bot\", :channel \"#monitoring\"
                                   :formatter (fn [e] {:text (:state e)
                                                       :icon \":happy:\"})))

  You can use `slack` inside of a grouping function which produces a seq of
  events, like `rollup`:

  (def slacker (slack credentials {:username \"Riemann bot\", :channel \"#monitoring\"
                                   :formatter (fn [es] {:text (apply str (map :state es))})))

  (rollup 5 60 slacker)

  ([account_name token username channel] (slack {:account account_name, :token token}
                                                {:username username, :channel channel}))
  ([{:keys [webhook_uri account token]}
    {:keys [username channel icon formatter] :or {formatter default-formatter}}]
   (fn [events]
     (let [{:keys [text attachments] :as result} (formatter events)
           icon (:icon result (or icon ":warning:"))
           channel (:channel result channel)
           username (:username result username)]
       (client/post (if webhook_uri
                      webhook_uri
                      (str "https://" account ".slack.com/services/hooks/incoming-webhook?token=" token))
                    {:form-params
                     {:payload (json/generate-string
                                 (merge
                                  {:channel channel, :username username, :icon_emoji icon}
                                  (when text {:text text})
                                  (dissoc result :icon :text)))}})))))
